    "Task": "Predicting lesion size measurements",
    "Type": "Regression",
    "Description": "You will be provided with a radiology report and instructed to extract one of the following lesion size measurements, depending on the specific task stated at the beginning of each case: (1) PDAC size, (2) pulmonary nodule size, or (3) RECIST target lesion sizes. For PDAC or pulmonary nodule tasks, extract the lesion size in millimeters and assign it to lesion_1; set lesion_2 through lesion_5 to 0. For RECIST tasks, extract the size in millimeters for each described target lesion (up to 5), and assign them to lesion_1 through lesion_5 in the order they appear; set any remaining lesion values to 0 if fewer than 5 are described.",
